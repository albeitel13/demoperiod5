One of her mother's cousins was part Vietnamese. She helped make those noodle bowls the first time my mom tried them. Vietnamese Vermicelli Noodle Bowls originated from Vietnam. The history of Vietnam started around 12,000 BC. Thousands of years later, there is evidence of Vietnamese people raising wet rice, herbs, plants, fish, and animals. Since the 2nd century, noodles were exported to Vietnam around the time of the East Han Dynasty. They adopted a way to create noodles in different and delicious ways. They are typically served dry with lots of fresh veggies, grilled meats, or seafood, and drizzled with a fish sauce. Noodle bowls are very customizable and you can put whatever you want in them. My mom makes her noodle bowl with <b><i>crispy carmelized pork</i></b>.</p>

Grill under indirect heat (if using charcoal grill), or medium/low heat (if using grill pan, electric grill, or skillet) to make sure the insides of the pork is completely cook. Note that because there is sugar in the marinate, pork will brown/burn quickly on the outside.</li>
